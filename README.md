# Mapping_Earthquakes

##Summary

After creating an earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay, the goal is to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth. Also, use the maping to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map,where they are located, and to see the data on a third map.

##Results

The earthquake data is shown on the maps in relation to the tectonic plates location around the earth, and according to each earthquakes specific magnitude. This can be done by using the drop down menu in the upper right hand corner of the map. You will be able to change between streets view, dark view, and satilite view. You will also be able to select/deselect values to be shown such as earthquakes, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes.
